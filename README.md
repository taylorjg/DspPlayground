## Description

I am currently reading
[_The Scientist & Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0966017633).
In an effort to try to understand it, I am implementing some of the algorithms in JavaScript
and visualising the results by rendering diagrams in [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG).
